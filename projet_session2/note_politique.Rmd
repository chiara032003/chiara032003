<u>Subject</u><span style="color:red;">: The Strategic Need for a NATO Doctrine on Hybrid War</span>


NATO was founded in 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty, with the primary aim of establishing a collective defense mechanism to deter potential aggression and maintain stability in the North Atlantic area, particularly in response to the growing influence and strategic posture of the Soviet Union during the early Cold War period.  Since the Beginning of the 21st century, the emergence of a new a warfare, “the hybrid warfare”   has compelled NATO to adapt its strategic posture and operational capabilities.  

NATO’s 2010 Bi-SC report laid the groundwork for a hybrid warfare doctrine, but it was Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea that truly catalyzed EU and NATO responses to hybrid threats.

NATO’s members have witnessed numerous hybrid threats in recent years, including disinformation campaigns such as the 'Crosses of David' operation in Paris, electoral interference in the United States (2016) and Romania (November 2024), cyber-attacks like the one targeting Estonia in 2007, and assaults on critical infrastructure, spanning energy, transport, and communication sectors. More recently, Russian drone incursions into European airspace, notably over Poland, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia, have further illustrated the evolving nature of these threats. Between 2022 and 2024, approximately 150 hybrid operations have targeted NATO member states, with Russia and, increasingly, China identified as key actors behind these activities . 

One of the key challenges NATO faces is the absence of a comprehensive doctrine on hybrid warfare, defined as an operational and strategic framework that would enable the Alliance to respond to such threats in a more coherent, anticipatory, and effective manner. 

While the Alliance has not yet adopted a single, binding hybrid warfare doctrine, several key summits have marked important steps toward a more coherent and institutionalized response. Key milestones include the 2014 Wales Summit, the 2016 Warsaw Summit, and the 2023 Vilnius Summit.

The 2014 Wales Summit marked a turning point in NATO’s strategic thinking. In the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, NATO formally recognized hybrid warfare as a critical challenge to Euro-Atlantic security. The summit introduced the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) and emphasized the need to develop tools to counter hybrid threats. This moment is widely seen as the starting point of NATO’s hybrid threat agenda, as noted by Colom Piella (2022), who argues that the Wales Summit laid the groundwork for a shift in NATO’s strategic culture, even if it stopped short of articulating a formal doctrine.

At the 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO moved from recognition to institutional response. The Alliance launched the Counter Hybrid Support Teams (CHSTs), deployable expert units designed to assist member states in identifying and responding to hybrid threats. The summit also emphasized resilience as a core component of collective defense, particularly in protecting critical infrastructure and countering disinformation. According to Davide Genini (2025), the Warsaw Summit represented a “doctrinal deepening” of NATO’s hybrid threat response, even though the Alliance continued to avoid codifying a unified doctrine. Instead, NATO opted for a modular and flexible approach, allowing member states to tailor their responses based on national contexts.

The 2023 Vilnius Summit reaffirmed NATO’s commitment to countering hybrid threats and integrating them into collective defense planning. As Genini (2025) notes, Vilnius marked a “doctrinal inflection point,” where NATO began to embed hybrid threat scenarios into its military exercises and strategic planning. However, the absence of a unified doctrine remains a challenge, with internal divisions among member states on how far the Alliance should go in formalizing hybrid warfare responses.

Moreover, the NATO’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, established in Riga in January 2014, became one of the organization’s pillars for combating disinformation and propaganda. 

Despite the establishment of Centers of Excellence, Counter Hybrid Support Teams (CHSTs), and various training initiatives, NATO member states have yet to reach a consensus on the development of a formal doctrine for hybrid warfare.

This is why I propose the development of a formal doctrine on hybrid warfare, beginning with a clear definition of its scope, namely, unconventional methods that fall below the threshold of armed conflict. These include disinformation campaigns, electoral interference, cyber-attacks, sabotage, electronic disruptions, and other malign activities. The doctrine should also incorporate rapid response mechanisms, such as the deployment of existing Counter Hybrid Support Teams (CHSTs). Furthermore, it should emphasize the strengthening of national and societal resilience, through improved protection of critical infrastructure and the promotion of civic preparedness and awareness.

Implementing this official doctrine raises the question of article 5 integration. Since 2016, NATO has explicitly stated that hybrid attacks could potentially trigger Article 5, the collective defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty. However, this is not automatic; it would be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on the scale and impact of the hybrid activity. For example, malicious cyber activities were acknowledged at the 2023 Vilnius Summit as potential triggers for Article 5. 

I believe NATO should formally acknowledge that certain hybrid attacks, particularly large-scale cyber operations or disinformation campaigns, may, depending on their severity, constitute acts of aggression under Article 5. To address this, NATO could establish a structured assessment mechanism to determine whether a hybrid attack warrants the invocation of Article 5. This framework could include a range of calibrated responses, such as economic sanctions, counter-disinformation strategies, and retaliatory cyber operations. 

From a political standpoint, it is important to recognize that NATO member states hold divergent views on the development of a hybrid warfare doctrine. On one side, countries on the frontlines of hybrid threats, particularly those originating from Russia, strongly advocate for doctrinal adaptation. This includes the Baltic states, Finland, Sweden, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, with the latter explicitly calling for a clarification of Article 5 to encompass hybrid attacks. On the other hand, several countries remain more hesitant, such as Italy, Turkey, Hungary, and Germany, citing concerns over the financial and operational costs associated with such a doctrinal shift.

In my view, this policy would significantly enhance NATO’s ability to respond to emerging hybrid threats in an increasingly complex global environment. Warfare today is no longer confined to conventional methods, a reality made especially clear in the context of the war in Ukraine, where hybrid tactics have played a prominent role. Moreover, this approach aligns with ongoing technological developments, which are key drivers of modern hybrid operations. These include both civilian technologies such as cognitive and disinformation warfare via social media and military capabilities like drones, cyber-attacks, and sabotage.

Conversely, this policy would entail extending Article 5 to cover non-military threats. From a realist perspective, such a move could create a security dilemma, as theorized by Kenneth Waltz, and potentially provoke adversaries, thereby increasing the risk of escalation. Moreover, the proposed doctrine could be perceived as overly aggressive toward Russia. Finally, financial constraints pose a significant challenge, particularly in the current context where member states have already to raise their defense spending to around 5% of GDP. It is uncertain whether all nations could sustain the additional costs this policy would require.

An alternative approach could involve strengthening cooperation with the European Union. In July 2016, NATO and EU enhanced their cooperation with the signing of a joint declaration in Warsaw. While cooperation between the two organizations in addressing hybrid threats has been largely positive , the same cannot be said for military mobility, where coordination remains limited and fragmented . This stems from the strength of informal cooperation mechanisms . It might be very beneficial thanks to mutual resources access. Both organizations acknowledge their interdependence: NATO benefits from EU’s civilian reach, while the EU gains transatlantic legitimacy and strategic depth. Moreover, the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats has played a key role in fostering EU-NATO cooperation by promoting conceptual clarity and facilitating staff exchanges. However, without a binding framework, responses may lack consistency or legal clarity, especially in crisis situations. Moreover, political blockages might remain consistent. Long-standing disputes such as Cyprus–Turkey, continue to limit full institutional integration. Finally, maintaining robust cooperation entails substantial organizational and human costs, as it demands significant financial and personnel resources, that may be difficult for some countries to mobilize consistently . 

The creation of a new doctrine entails both significant costs and potential benefits. 

Member states would need to increase NATO and national defense budgets to invest in cyber capabilities, training, and institutional coordination, for instance, by expanding NATO’s Communication Centre of Excellence. Political communication costs would also rise, as counter-narratives and public awareness campaigns would need to be substantially reinforced. Indirect costs include heightened diplomatic tensions with Russia and China, which could increase the risk of escalation. Internal fragmentation poses another challenge, given divergences among members on the definition of ‘hybrid threats’ and the difficulty of harmonizing national policies. Furthermore, implementation could lead to excessive securitization and encroachments on freedom of expression, such as intensified monitoring of social media.  At the individual level, growing distrust toward institutions and media may complicate efforts to distinguish reliable sources. Socially, in my view, the most dangerous cost would be that the informational space risks becoming increasingly militarized, raising ethical dilemmas.

The implementation of a NATO hybrid warfare doctrine would yield significant benefits across multiple dimensions. 

At the societal level, it would enhance collective preparedness for hybrid crises and foster coordinated action among public, private, and civil actors. For individuals, it would reduce exposure to disinformation and improve the protection of personal data and digital services. Directly, the doctrine would strengthen collective security by improving threat detection, inter-ally coordination, and the efficient deployment of cyber and informational resources. Indirectly, it would bolster deterrence by clarifying NATO’s posture, reduce strategic ambiguity, support geopolitical stability in vulnerable regions such as Eastern Europe, and stimulate innovation in fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and cognitive science.

The adoption of a NATO hybrid warfare doctrine appears both feasible and increasingly necessary. Despite potential reluctance from some member states, the growing prevalence of hybrid threats, exemplified by recent drone incursions in Europe, underscores the urgency of a unified response. A formal doctrine would reduce ambiguity, clarify response mechanisms, and diminish the strategic advantage of surprise often exploited by adversaries. In the current geopolitical context, particularly with the war in Ukraine highlighting the centrality of hybrid tactics, such a doctrine would serve as a strategic anchor. While positive externalities include technological innovation and enhanced coordination among allies, negative spillovers must also be considered. These include the risk of global rearmament, and a potential intensification of disinformation campaigns worldwide, raising the specter of a broader security dilemma. 

Regarding the costs and benefits of both proposed policies, I believe it could be more efficient creating a new doctrine. Strengthening cooperation with the EU should be considered as a “first step” to struggle against hybrid threats.
